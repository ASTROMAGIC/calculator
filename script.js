// basic calculator prograqm 

// have gone back to the drawing board with the js that will be written 

let currentNum = "";
let previousNum = "";
let operator = ""; 

const currentDisplayNumber = document.querySelector("currentNum");
const previousDisplayNumber = document.querySelector("previousNum"); 

// made some basic variables, somewhat stumped on the direction that I need to take
