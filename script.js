// basic calculator prograqm 

// have gone back to the drawing board with the js that will be written 


// I have now had time to read the code of other people who have completed this project and this what I believe I need so far; 

// Variables for my buttons, my operators, and my display

// lots of these will contain empty strings 

// there is no need for button onclick functions in my html file.
